# Documenting and Communicating Software Architecture

This repository contains examples I use for talks and workshops about documentation and communication of software architecture.

The folder [C4](C4) contains diagrams of the popular [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) of an imaginary system called "Unicorn Webshop".
